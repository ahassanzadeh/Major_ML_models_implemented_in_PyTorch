# Major_RL_models_implemented_in_PyTorch
In this repository, A straightforward Pytorch implementation of the Deep Reinforcement Learning Algorithm such as Soft Actor Critic are presented for the one trying to learn Reinforcement Learning algorithms as simple as possible. I would be happy to answer any questions.
